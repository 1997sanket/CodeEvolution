1. There are two options to export components in React
    a) named export     
        -We have the import the component using the same name
    b) default export
        -We can import the component using different name


2. From React 18 onwards, we can use Functional Components only

3. JSX = The thing which we return from a function, which looks like HTML but it not.
            It is basically a syntax extension for JavaScript

4. props = used to send properties to components. It is an arugment of the functional compoment
            In TS, it can be of type or interfce
            -using props.children, we can also access JSX tag's child component
            -One problem with props are they are immutable, their values cannot be changed.

5.      props                            vs                          state
    -passed to the component                        -managed by the component
    -immutable                                      -mutable
    -used by getting props object                   -used by "useState()" Hook


6. Some important hooks
    -useState, useEffect, and useTransition

7. Event handling
    -check out the important event from ChatGPT

8. Parent Child components communication
    Parent comp will have Child Comp in the JSX, in the child comp, we will press a button and it should send a data to the parent comp. To do that onClick we will call a function on props,
    this function is sent by the parent component in the Child tag; so basically we are calling
    Parent's method from the Child component's onClick event.


9. Conditional Rendering
        -Refer Greet component

10. List rendering
        -Refer PersonList component

11. Form handling

12. HTTP requests

13. useTransition hook

14. Further learning
        -Router
        -React Query
        -More hooks maybe
